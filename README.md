# US-Honey-Production
Exploratory Data Analysis on US Honey production data from kaggle for the years 1998-2012


I have visually analyzed data in the Honey production dataset from kaggle using R. 
This dataset is already cleaned dataset, there is no need for data munging in the dataset. I have used R to do some data analysis using dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

Any suggestions or feedback would be highly appreciated.

This repo here contains the ipython notebook and the dataset used which is a csv file from kaggle.
